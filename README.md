## Learning Approach

|Principle 	             |Description                                                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|Logic First 	           |Build solutions without over-relying on built-in shortcuts |
|Clean Code 	           |Write modular, reusable methods with clear naming          |
|Edge Cases 	           |Handle invalid input, overflow, and boundary conditions    |
|Real-World Mapping 	   |Scenario-based problems mirror actual use cases            |
|Incremental Growth 	   |Start simple, then add validation and optimization         |
